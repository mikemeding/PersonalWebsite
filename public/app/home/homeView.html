    <p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a graduate student at UMass Lowell studying Computer
        Science and I enjoy many disciplines of programming. I've been working at a small company as a software developer
        part time for the last 3 years and have been involved with many interesting projects during that time.</p>

            <p>I wrote a Scheme program that can talk to an Arduino which interprets and displays text. Scheme is a very old LISP-derivative language that
                had no
                support for something like this and was an interesting challenge to make it work.</p>

            <p>For my Natural Language Processing course as an undergrad was a Twitter sentiment analyzer that was designed to detect
                the presence of bullying by tracking certain hashtags.</p>

            <p>Angular Bootstrap Modal Forms (AnBoMoFo) is an AngularJS library that I wrote for easy form creation and
                manipulation. I manage a lot of form data for the company I work for and needed a quick and easy way to
                create new forms. Below is an example of this library in action.</p>
