    <p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a graduate student at UMass Lowell studying Computer
        Science and I enjoy many disciplines of programming. I've been working at a small company as a software
        developer
        part time for the last 3 years and have been involved with many interesting projects during that time.</p>
