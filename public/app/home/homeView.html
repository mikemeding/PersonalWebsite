    <p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a graduate student at UMass Lowell studying Computer
        Science and I enjoy many disciplines of programming. I've been working at a small company as a software
        developer
        part time for the last 3 years and have been involved with many interesting projects during that time.</p>

            <p>Pictured below are my 3D printers. Both of these printers are hand built reprap 3d printers based on the
                prusai3 layout. The first printer is a laser cut acrylic frame standard prusai3 with a few custom parts
                and
                was my first foray into 3D printing. The second printer is much more sophisticated which I
                built to help me with my masters research. Both printers are web enabled and are tuned well enough to
                produce models which rival much more expensive machines.</p>

            <p>Angular Bootstrap Modal Forms (AnBoMoFo) is an AngularJS library that I wrote for easy form creation and
                manipulation. I manage a lot of form data for the company I work for and needed a quick and easy way to
                create new forms. Below is an example of this library in action.</p>

            <p>I wrote a Scheme program that can talk to an Arduino which interprets and displays text. Scheme is a very
                old LISP-derivative language that
                had no
                support for something like this and was an interesting challenge to make it work.</p>
