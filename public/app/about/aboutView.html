<h2 class="text-center">Who am I?</h2>

<h4>Hello!</h4>

<p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a senior at UMass Lowell majoring in Computer Science. I
    enjoy many disciplines of programming, such as web-coding and application programming. While I'm at college,
    I've been working at a small company as a software developer, but that is far from my dream job.</p>

<p>I like fast things. My goal when I graduate from college is to work in automotive applications programming to
    improve race car technology. I have always had a passion for cars, at one point in my life I was even a
    mechanic, and by mixing both computer science and cars, there's almost nothing else I need in my life. </p>
<h4>Really? You have no hobbies?</h4>

<p>Hey! I have hobbies! Besides obsessing over cars, I love cycling, snowboarding, paintball, playing guitar, and
    photography. I have also started to dabble in film editing. I like to try out a lot of different things and I
    love learning random and useless facts. For example, did you know that the type of bananas we buy at the grocery
    store are a breed called cavendish?</p>
<h4>But Mike, we still want to know, how did you get started?</h4>

<p>(with computer programming, not learning random facts...) </p>

<p>I really got interested in programming when I started working for this company called Outsmart. At first, I was
    working on the product
    assembly line churning out little plastic devices. Lucky for me, production started to slow down, and I was
    moved to writing small scripts to help
    automate some of the manufacturing processes. That's when I reached what I call my darkest hour. I was on
    downward spiral until I was drinking 5 cups of coffee a day and churning
    out thousands of lines of real enterprise code.</p>
<h4>Do you have any cool projects?</h4>

<p>Recently I've been playing around with an firmware based device called an arduino. Below you'll find a video of
    my final project last semester using the arduino.</p>
