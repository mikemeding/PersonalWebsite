    <h3>Hello!</h3>

    <p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a graduate student at UMass Lowell studying Computer
        Science and Ienjoy many disciplines of programming. I've been working at a small company as a software developer
        part time for the last 3 years and have been involved with many interesting projects during that time.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies?</h3>

    <p>I'm an Avid cyclist, snowboarder, paintball player and car mechanic who loves the outdoors.</p>

    <h3>Motivation?</h3>

    <p>I really got interested in programming when I started working for this company called Outsmart. At first, I was
        working on the product
        assembly line churning out little plastic devices. Lucky for me, production started to slow down, and I was
        moved to writing small scripts to help
        automate some of the manufacturing processes.
        From there I quickly picked up much more complicated coding concepts and before I knew it I was writing
        production code.
