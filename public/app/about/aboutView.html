    <h2 class="text-center">About</h2>

    <h3>Hello!</h3>

    <p>My name is Michael Meding, or just Mike for short. I'm a senior at UMass Lowell majoring in Computer Science. I
        enjoy many disciplines of programming, such as web-coding and application programming. While I'm at college,
        I've been working at a small company as a software developer, but that is far from my dream job.</p>

    <p>I like fast things. My goal when I graduate from college is to work in automotive applications programming to
        improve race car technology. I have always had a passion for cars, at one point in my life I was even a
        mechanic, and by mixing both computer science and cars, there's almost nothing else I need in my life. </p>

    <h3>Really? You have no hobbies?</h3>

    <p>Hey! I have hobbies! I love cycling, snowboarding, paintball, playing guitar, fixing cars, and
        photography. I like to try out a lot of different things and I love learning random and useless facts.
    </p>

    <h3>But Mike, we still want to know, how did you get started?</h3>

    <p>I really got interested in programming when I started working for this company called Outsmart. At first, I was
        working on the product
        assembly line churning out little plastic devices. Lucky for me, production started to slow down, and I was
        moved to writing small scripts to help
        automate some of the manufacturing processes.
        From there I quickly picked up much more complicated coding concepts and before I knew it I was writing production code.
