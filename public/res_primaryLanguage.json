      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mike! I am a formally trained software engineer with years of professional experience building full stack web and non-web applications. These applications ranged from operational support software to detailed energy data analytics and included both structured SQL and unstructured data. While software engineering accounts for the bulk of my professional career, it is far from the only set of skills in my repertoire. Working primarily with startup companies has provided me with multifaceted skillsets, from frontend UI/UX development to bare metal electrical/mechanical engineering work. While earning my Master's degree at University of Massachusetts Lowell, I developed a passion for 3D printing and its adjacent technologies and wrote one of the first cloud-based slicing engines, consisting of software that turns digital models into 3D printer compatible gcode. At Zea Biosciences I built a platform which took both user and sensor data to do live plant condition analysis.",
